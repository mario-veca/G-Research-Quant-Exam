# G-Research Quant Exam - Exercise 11
(**Last Updated**: January 31, 2025)

This repository provides a detailed solution to the final problem in the **G-Research Sample Quant Exam**, labeled as the hardest (and hence the most interesting).  
The problem challenges players to select a positive integer in a way that maximizes their chances of winning, given that the **smallest unique choice wins the game**.  
Despite its simple rules, solving this problem requires **creativity, careful reasoning, and a deep understanding of Nash equilibria**.

This solution derives the equilibrium equations, finds an explicit solution, and **rigorously proves its uniqueness**.  

To validate the theoretical results, we also include **numerical computations** and a visualization of the function S(p_1).  

The original problem can be found in the **[G-Research Sample Quant Exam](https://www.gresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sample-Quant-Exa.pdf)**. 

## üìÑ Contents
- **`Ex_11_G-Research.pdf`**: The main document, detailing the mathematical solution to the problem.
- **`Ex_11_G-Research.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with Python code to visualize the function S(p_1) derived in the document.

## üî¨ Overview
This project investigates the **strategic decision-making process** in a combinatorial setting, analyzing:
- The derivation of equilibrium equations.
- A solution ansatz for the equations.
- A formal proof of uniqueness.
- Computational validation through function plotting.

## üìä Visualization
The **Jupyter Notebook** provided (`Ex_11_G-Research.ipynb`) generates the function S(p_1), illustrating the theoretical results numerically.
